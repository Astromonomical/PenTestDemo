<p>Hi, and welcome to my introduction to penetration testing. The goal of this lab is to give a very soft introduction to the world of penetration testing through several tasks. While relatively straight forward, I hope they serve as a gentle introduction to getting into the field. In this demo, there are several tasks included:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Using Network Mapper to scan a local network</li>
  <li> Using SQL Injection to attack a website </li>
  <li> A basic look at a buffer overflow </li>
 </ul>
<p>To use this file, you will require a raspberry pi. To run, download the zip file from the link. Extract the contents of the zip and using a tool such as balena etcher, flash the Demo.image file to a microSD then insert into the raspberry pi</p>

Please remember that attempting any of these methods on a system for which you don't have permission to attack is against the law.

Any feedback for this is much appreciated!
