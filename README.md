<h1>Introduction to Penetration Testing</h1>
<p>Hi, and welcome to my introduction to penetration testing. The goal of this lab is to give a very soft introduction to the world of penetration testing through several tasks. While relatively straight forward, I hope they serve as a gentle introduction to getting into the field. In this demo, there are several tasks included:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Using Network Mapper to scan a local network</li>
  <li> Using SQL Injection to attack a website </li>
  <li> A basic look at a buffer overflow </li>
 </ul>
<p>To use this file, you will need some kind of virtual machine software. For these intructions I will be using Virtual Box. First, get the contents of this repository. Then, using Virtual Box go to Machine > New and set the type to Linux and the version to Debian (32-bit). Click next, add a virtual hard drive and set to VDI then click next through to creating the machine. Then, with the machine selected go to settings > storage and click the left most bottom button and select "add floppy controller". Then find the img file and add as a medium. Boot up and open the lab sheet to follow along!</p>

Please remember that attempting any of these methods on a system for which you don't have permission to attack is against the law.

Any feedback for this is much appreciated!
